## Introduction
Blazor projects utilize Razor components as the bulding blocks of the application. These components also have the ability to contain logic specific to themselves, creating reusable pieces of UI for your fronend.

Spark uses Blazor SSR and HTMX under the hood, so understanding how Razor components work is crucial.

## Creating Components
You can create a new Razor component by hand or by running the following Spark CLI command:

```bash
spark make component DeveloperDetails
```
After running this command, Spark will create 2 new files in your application.

The first will be a code behind file: `Pages/Shared/DeveloperDetails.cs`.

```csharp
namespace MyApp.Pages.Shared;

public partial class DeveloperDetails
{
    protected override void OnInitialized()
    {
        
    }
}
```

The second will be the Razor file: `Pages/Shared/DeveloperDetails.razor`

```razor
<div>

</div>
```

You can create components in subdirectories as well. For example, the following commands will create a `DeveloperDetails` component in the `Pages/Shared/Developers` subdirectory.
```bash
spark make component Developers/DeveloperDetails
```

### Inline Components
If your component is fairly small, you can create an **inline** component. Inline components are a single .razor file that have an `@code` block to contain it's logic, rather than a seperate code behind file.
```razor
<div>

</div>

@code {
    protected override void OnInitialized()
    {
        
    }
}
```

To create an inline component, run the Spark make component command and pass the `--inline` flag.
```bash
spark make component DeveloperDetails --inline
```

## Component Properties
Razor components have properties that can store data and be accessed from within your code behind class or razor component markup.

To add a property to a razor component, declare a property in your code behind file. For example, we can create a `string name` property in the `DeveloperDetails` component:
```csharp
namespace MyApp.Pages.Shared;

public partial class DeveloperDetails
{
    private string name = 'Art Vandelay';

    protected override void OnInitialized()
    {
        
    }
}
```

### Accessing Properties in Markup
Component properties can referenced in the components markup using Microsofts razor syntax. Here we can display the value of the `name` property:
```razor
<div>
    <p>Name: @name</p>
</div>
```

The resulting output of this component would be:
```razor
<div>
    <p>Name: Art Vandelay</p>
</div>
```

### Passing Data Into Components
Component properties tagged as a parameter allow you to pass data into components.

They are defined as a property in your Razor component with the `[Parameter]` attribute and must be declared as **public**.
```csharp
namespace MyApp.Pages.Shared;

public partial class DeveloperDetails
{
    [Parameter] public string Name { get; set; }

    protected override void OnInitialized()
    {
        
    }
}
```

When rendering a component, you can pass the parameter value as an argument in the HTML tag of the component.
```razor
<DeveloperDetails Name="Art Vandelay" />
```

> Tip!
>
> You can add the attribute `EditorRequired` to a parameter. 
>
> ```csharp
> [Parameter, EditorRequired] public string Name { get; set; }
> ```
>
> This will alert you in your editor that the components property is required when referencing it.

## Dependency Injection in Components
You can take advantage of ASP.NET's dependency injection system by adding the `[Inject]` attribute to a property in your code behind class. 

.NET will automatically resolve the dependency for you provided it has been registered in the apps service container.
```csharp
namespace MyApp.Pages.Shared;

public partial class DeveloperDetails
{
    [Inject] public IConfiguration Config { get; set; }
    private string name = '';

    protected override void OnInitialized()
    {
        name = Config.GetValue<string>("Developer:Name");
    }
}
```

### Inline Components
You can also take advantage of dependency injection in inline components by using the `@inject` attribute followed by the service to inject.
```razor
@inject IConfiguration Config

<div>
</div>

@code {
    private string name = '';

    protected override void OnInitialized()
    {
        name = Config.GetValue<string>("Developer:Name");
    }
}
```


## Rendering Components
To display a component, you can use a Razor component tag within another Razor component or page. Razor component tags are just the name of it's source file.
```razor
<DeveloperDetails />
```

As mentioned above, if you can also pass data into components if they have properties tagged with the `[Parameter]` attribute.

```razor
<DeveloperDetails Name="Art Vandelay" />
```

### Child Content
You will often need to pass additional content to your razor components via a `RenderFragment`. RenderFragments can be HTML markup or even other Razor Components.

For example, the below `ChildComponent.razor` component has a `ChildContent` parameter of type `RenderFragment`. This represents a segment of UI to render.
```razor
<h1>
    @ChildContent
</h1>

@code {
    [Parameter]
    public RenderFragment? ChildContent { get; set; }
}
```

In a parent Razor component, you can render the child component while passing content between it's opening and closing tags.
```razor
<ChildComponent>
    Spark is <span class="text-yellow-600">Awesome!</span>
</ChildComponent>
```

The following markup would be rendered to the browser.
```html
<h1>
    Spark is <span class="text-yellow-600">Awesome!</span>
</h1>
```

## Render Modes
Blazor comes with a couple different ways to render your components.

Currently, Spark uses the Blazor **Server** render mode. You can read more about Blazor Server [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/?view=aspnetcore-7.0#blazor-server)

In .NET 8, Blazor introduces Server Side Rendering and the ability to change render modes on a per component basis. Spark will take advantage of both of these.

Spark does not support the WASM render mode. If you'd like to hear me rant about why, feel free to DM me on Twitter.
