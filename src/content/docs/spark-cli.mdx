## Introduction
Spark provides a custom command line interface to improve your developer experience.

To install the Spark CLI, simply run the following command:
```bash
dotnet tool install -g Spark.CLI
```

### Updating Spark CLI
The Spark CLI is constantly being updated. To update to the newest version, simply uninstall and reinstall it.
```bash
dotnet tool uninstall -g Spark.CLI
dotnet tool install -g Spark.CLI
```



## Install
Install the Spark Templates. This must be ran 1 time before creating your first Spark project.
```bash
spark install
```

## Update
Update the installed Spark Templates. It's recommended to run this before creating new projects as Spark is being improved constantly.
```bash
spark update
```

## Create Project
Create a Spark project.
```bash
spark new [projectName]
```

## Open Project
Opens a Spark project with your default editor.
```bash
spark open
```

## Create Migration
Create a EF Core migration.
```bash
spark make migration [migrationName]
```
The new migration will be under `Application/Database/Migrations`.

## Run Migration
Runs outstanding migrations.
```bash
spark migrate
```

## Create Component
Create an new Razor component.
```bash
spark make component [ComponentName]
```
The new component will be under `Pages/Shared`. 

The command accepts subfolders as well. For instance, `spark make component Profile/ProfileDetails` would make a new component at `Pages/Shared/Profile/ProfileDetails.razor`.

All components are created with a code behind file as well. 

So `Pages/Shared/Profile/ProfileDetails.razor` would also have a code behind file of `Pages/Shared/Profile/ProfileDetails.cs` created with it.

### Inline Components
If you prefer to combine your razor and code behind files into 1 .razor file, you can pass the `--inline` flag.

```bash
spark make page [PageName] --inline
```

## Create Page
Create an new Blazor page.
```bash
spark make page [PageName]
```
The new page will be under `Pages`. 

The command accepts subfolders as well. For instance, `spark make page Profile/Index` would make a new Blazor page at `Pages/Profile/Index.razor`.

All pages are created with a code behind file as well. So the `Pages/Profile/Index.razor` page would also have a code behind file of `Pages/Profile/Index.cs` created with it.

### Inline Pages
If you prefer to combine your razor and code behind files into 1 .razor file, you can pass the `--inline` flag.

```bash
spark make page [PageName] --inline
```

## Create Event

spark make event [eventName] [listenerName]
```
The new event will be under `Application/Events`. The new listener will be under `./Application/Events/Listeners`

```bash
spark make mail [mailableName]
```
The new mailable will be under `Application/Mail`.
