## Introduction
Jobs represent a self contained task within your system. Spark utilizes Coravel's [invocables](https://docs.coravel.net/Invocables/) to accomplish this.

In most cases, a Job will either be used in a background queue or as a scheduled job.

For example, using Spark's scheduler, you can schedule a job that checks for inactive user accounts every 5 minutes.

```csharp
scheduler.Schedule<FindInactiveUsersJob>()
    .EveryFiveMinutes();
```

### Creating Jobs
All job classes are required to use the shared interface `Coravel.Invocable.IInvocable`.

To create a new job, simply run the Spark `make job` command.
```bash
spark make job ExampleJob
```

A new job will be created in the `Application/Jobs` directory.
```csharp
public class ExampleJob : IInvocable
{

    public ExampleJob()
    {
    }

    public Task Invoke()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Do something in the background.");
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```
### Class Structure
Job classes are very simple, usually only containing a constructor and a `Invoke()` method that is invoked when the job is processed. This is where your logic for the job will be placed. 

### Registering Jobs
Your jobs also have to be registered in the service container.

You can do this by adding your job with the transient lifetime in the `Application.Startup.AppServiceRegistration.AddJobServices()` method.
```csharp
private static IServiceCollection AddJobServices(this IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddTransient<ExampleJob>();
    return services;
}
```

Once your job is registered in the service container, you can inject other services into it.

```csharp
public class ExampleJob : IInvocable
{
    private readonly DatabaseContext _db;

    public ExampleJob(DatabaseContext db)
    {
        _db = db;
    }

    public Task Invoke()
    {
        var users = _db.Users.ToList();
        // do something with the users.

        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```
