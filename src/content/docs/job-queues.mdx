## Introduction
Offloading long running jobs to the background is a great way to increase performance in you web app. Spark utilizes Coravel's [queuing](https://docs.coravel.net/Queuing/) to accomplish this.

For example, lets say when a user signs up to your app, you send a welcome email to them.

Instead of waiting for that email to send while the user waits for their HTTP request to finish, you could offload that email sending to a job in Spark's Queue.

## Setup
Spark registers the Queue in the `Application.Startup.AppServiceRegistration.AddAppServices()` method for you.
```csharp
services.AddQueue();
```

To use the Queue, you can inject an instance of `Coravel.Queueing.Interface.IQueue` inteface into a controller, razor component, or another registered service.
```csharp
IQueue _queue;

public MyController(IQueue queue) {
    this._queue = queue;
}
```

## Queueing Jobs
To queue a job, use the `QueueInvocable` method.
```csharp
this._queue.QueueInvocable<ExampleJob>();
```

### Queue With a Payload
Sometimes you will have a scenario where you want to pass paramaters to your job.

To accomplish this, you first need to add Coravel's `InvocableWithPayload<T>` interface to your existing job.

```csharp
public class ExampleJob : IInvocable, IInvocableWithpayload<User>
{
    public User User { get; set; }

    public ExampleJob()
    {
    }

    public Task Invoke()
    {
        // this.User is now available for you to use.
        Console.WriteLine("Do something in the background.");
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```

Now you can queue the job with the `QueueInvocableWithPayload` method.
```csharp
var user = await _db.Find(userId);
queue.QueueInvocableWithPayload<ExampleJob, User>(user);
```
