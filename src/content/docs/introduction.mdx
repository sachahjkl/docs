## Why Spark.NET?
Spark.NET is an open-source web framework that embraces ASP.NET and Entity Framework fundamentals while extending their capabilities, enabling developers to build feature-rich web applications quickly. 

Spark Projects come with a backend library, full of features like:
- Authentication
- Database connections
- Data access
- Queues
- Scheduled jobs
- Events
- Mail
 
 Our goal is to empower you to build exceptional web applications with ease without having to create the plumbing of these common features yourself.

Spark also provides custom CLI [commands](/docs/spark-cli) to improve your developer experience. The Spark CLI helps you create new projects, migrations, controllers and other project files with ease. 

Currently, when creating a new project, you can choose between 3 starter templates:
- Blazor
- MVC
- Razor Pages

## Getting Started
To get started with Spark.NET, follow our [installation guide](/docs/installation).
