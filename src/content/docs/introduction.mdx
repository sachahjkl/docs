## Why Spark.NET?

Spark.NET is a web application framework that embraces ASP.NET and Entity Framework fundamentals while extending their capabilities and adding new ones, enabling developers to build feature-rich web applications quickly. 

Our goal is to empower you to build exceptional web applications with ease.

#### Get a Head Start

Every Spark project comes scaffolded with authentication, authorization, database connections, entity framework, and more already configured.

It also provides login, register, user dashboards, and user profile pages scaffolded and hooked into Spark's authentication services.

Currently, when creating a new project, you can choose between 3 starter templates:
- Blazor
- MVC
- Razor Pages

#### Don't Sweath the Small Stuff

You want to focus on developing important features, not underlying plumbing. 

To help with that, Spark comes with many out of the box service so you don't have to waste time reinventing the wheel.
- Authentication
- Mail
- Logging
- Events & Listeners
- Background Queues
- Scheduled Jobs

#### An Enjoyable Developer Experience

Every Spark project comes with the same project structure, ensuring you know where everything is, whether it's your first time on a project or not.

Spark also provides custom CLI [tool](/docs/spark-cli) to improve your developer experience. The Spark CLI helps you create new projects, migrations, services, controllers and other project files with ease. 

## Getting Started
To get started with Spark.NET, follow our [installation guide](/docs/installation).

If you prefer learning by video, check out our [Spark for Beginners tutorial](/docs/beginner-tutorial) instead.
