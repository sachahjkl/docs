## Introduction
Spark utilizes role based authorization and it is already scaffolded for you.

## Role Models
Every Spark app comes with a `Role` model in the `Application/Models` directory. Roles can control what pages logged in users see. A user can be assigned a role through the `UserRole` relationship.
```csharp
public class Role : BaseModel
{
    public Role()
    {
        UserRoles = new HashSet<UserRole>();
    }

    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }

    public virtual ICollection<UserRole> UserRoles { get; set; }
}
```

## Custom Roles
By default, a Spark app comes with 2 roles out of the box. `Admin` and `User`.
```csharp
public static class CustomRoles
{
    public const string Admin = nameof(Admin);
    public const string User = nameof(User);
}
```
### Adding More Custom Roles
You can add more custom roles if needed.

First, add the new custom role to the `Application/Models/CustomRoles.cs` class.
```csharp
public static class CustomRoles
{
    public const string Admin = nameof(Admin);
    public const string User = nameof(User);
    public const string NewRole = nameof(NewRole);
}
```

Second, add the new custom role record to the `Roles` database table.

The easiest way to do this is utilizing the `OnModelCreating` method in the `DatabaseContext` class. In it, you can make entity framework insert the record when running a migration.

Spark does this for you already with the Admin and User roles. Just add your new Role to it.
```csharp
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder builder) {
    
    ...

    builder.Entity<Role>().HasData(
        new Role { Id = 1, Name = CustomRoles.User },
        new Role { Id = 2, Name = CustomRoles.Admin },
        new Role { Id = 3, Name = CustomRoles.NewRole }
    );
}
```

## Using Authorization to gate content
You can use Roles to determine what type of users can access what content. Simply use the `Authorize` attribute and pass in a custom role.

### Using Authorization in MVC Controllers
```csharp
public class AdminController : Controller
{
    [HttpGet]
    [Authorize(Policy = CustomRoles.Admin)]
    [Route("admin/dashboard")]
    public IActionResult Dashboard()
    {
        return View();
    }
}
```

### Using Authorization in Razor Pages
```csharp
[Authorize(Policy = CustomRoles.Admin)]
public class DashboardModel : PageModel
{
    public void OnGet()
    {
    }
}
```

### Using Authorization in Razor Components
```razor
@page "/admin/dashboard"
@attribute [Authorize(Roles = CustomRoles.Admin)]
<section class="max-w-5xl mx-auto py-28 min-h-screen px-4">
    <article>
        <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">
            Admin Dashboard
        </h1>
    </article>
</section>
```

You can also combine `<AuthorizeView>` with roles to display different content on a page based on a User's role.
```razor
@page "/admin/dashboard"
@attribute [Authorize]
<section>
    <article>
        <AuthorizeView Roles="@CustomRoles.Admin">
            <Authorized>
                <h1>
                    Admin Dashboard
                </h1>
            </Authorized>
            <NotAuthorized>
                <h1>
                    No soup for you!
                </h1>
            </NotAuthorized>
        </AuthorizeView>
    </article>
</section>
```
