## Introduction
Spark comes with several project templates. This gives you the flexibility to use whatever ASP.NET project type you'd like while also taking advantage of all the functionality Spark provides.

Every project template comes with the same Spark functionality and services. The main differences is how their routes, markup, and markup logic is constructed.

## Templates
### Blazor
The Blazor project type sets up a Blazor Server project for you.

Blazor projects utilize Razor components to split your markdown into re-usable chunks. These components also have the ability to contain logic specific to themselves.

To create a Spark Blazor project, simply run the following command.
```bash
spark new MyAppName -t blazor
```

To read more about Spark Blazor projects, check out our documentation [here](/docs/blazor)

### MVC
The MVC project type sets up a ASP.NET MVC project for you.

MVC projects follow the conventional Model-View-Controller pattern. For it's frontend, it uses the Razor templating engine and server side generation.

Every page in a MVC app is made up of a razor view file that corresponds to a controller method for it's logic.

To create a Spark MVC project, simply run the following command.
```bash
spark new MyAppName -t mvc
```

### Razor Pages
The Razor Pages project type sets up a ASP.NET Razor Pages project for you.

For it's frontend, it uses the Razor templating engine and server side generation. It differs from MVC in that it doesn't use controllers.

Instead, every razor view file can have a `PageModel` class to define that pages logic.

To create a Spark Razor Pages project, simply run the following command.
```bash
spark new MyAppName -t razor
```

## What project type should I use?

The choice is entirely up to you.

Some devs choose **MVC** because they like the code seperation it provides.

Some devs choose **Razor Pages** because they like the simplicity is provides with views and thier corresponding models.

Some devs choose **Blazor** because of the user experience it provides and being able to componetize markup.

In the end, the choice is yours and all 3 work very well. Our advice is just pick one and start building.
