## Introduction
Blazor projects utilize Razor components to split your markdown into re-usable chunks. These components also have the ability to contain logic specific to themselves.

Spark uses **Blazor Server** under the hood, so everything is rendered on the server.

Razor components let you mix in HTML markup with C#, allowing you to quickly create dynamic components to use in your app.

```razor
@inject DeveloperService _developerService

<ul>
    @foreach (var developer in developers)
    {
    <li>
        @developer.Name
    </li>
    }
</ul>

@code {
    private List<Developer> developers { get; set; }
    protected override void OnInitialized()
    {
        developers = await _developerService.GetDevelopers();
    }
}
```

## Creating a Blazor project
To create a Spark Blazor project, simply run the following command.
```bash
spark new MyAppName -t blazor
```

## Components
Razor components are re-usable elements you can use anywhere in your application.

Your components should be created in the `Pages/Shared` directory.

### Creating Razor Components
To create a new Razor component, simply run the Spark make component command.

```bash
spark make component SomeComponent
```
A new Razor component named `SomeComponent.razor` will be created in the `Pages/Shared` directory.

```razor
<p>My Component</p>

@code {

    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
    {
        
    }
}
```

### Rendering Components
To display a component, you may use a Razor component tag within another Razor component or page. Razor component tags are just the name of it's source file.
```razor
<SomeComponent />
```

### Passing Data To Components
You can pass data to a Razor component or page by using **Component Parameters**.

Component parameters are defined using public C# properties on the component class with the `[Parameter]` attribute.

For example, below is a razor component called `ChildComponent.razor`. It accepts a parameter of `Title`.
```razor
<h1>@Title</h1>

@code {
    [Parameter]
    public string Title { get; set; } = "";
}
```

Then, in a parent Razor component, you can render the child component and pass the `Title` parameter value.
```razor
<div>
    <SomeComponent Title="This is my title" />
</div>

@code {
}
```

In this example, the following markup would ultimately be rendered to the browser.
```html
<div>
    <h1>This is my title</h1>
</div>
```

### Child Content
You will often need to pass additional content to your razor components via a `RenderFragment`. RenderFragments can be HTML markup or even other Razor Components.

For example, the below `ChildComponent.razor` component has a `ChildContent` parameter of type `RenderFragment`. This represents a segment of UI to render.
```razor
<h1>
    @ChildContent
</h1>

@code {
    [Parameter]
    public RenderFragment? ChildContent { get; set; }
}
```

Then, in a parent Razor component, you can render the child component while passing content between it's opening and closing tags.
```razor
<ChildComponent>
    Spark is <span class="text-yellow-600">Awesome!</span>
</ChildComponent>
```

In this example, the following markup would ultimately be rendered to the browser. 
```html
<h1>
    Spark is <span class="text-yellow-600">Awesome!</span>
</h1>
```


## Pages
Your Blazor pages should be created in the `Pages` directory.

A Blazor page is a Razor component with a `@page "/some-url"` attribute at the top that represents the url it's located at.

### Creating Blazor Pages
To create a new Blazor page, simply run the Spark make page command.

```bash
spark make page Users/Index
```

A new Blazor Page named `Index.razor` will be created in the `Pages/Users` directory.

### Route Parameters
The Blazor router uses route parameters to populate corresponding component parameters with the same name. Route parameter names are case insensitive.

```razor
@page "/developers/{Id:int}"

@if (developer != null) {
    <h1>@developer.Name</h1>
}

@code {
    [Parameter]
    public int Id { get; set; }
	private Developer developer { get; set; }
    
	protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
	{
		developer = await _developerService.Get(Id);
	}
}
```

### Page title and metadata
You can set a Blazor pages `<title>` element by using the `PageTitle` component.
```razor
@page "/developers"

<PageTitle>This is the developers page</PageTitle>
```

To set metadata, like the pages description, use the `HeadContent` component.
```razor
@page "/developers"

<PageTitle>This is the developers page</PageTitle>
<HeadContent>
    <meta name="description" content="This is a page that shows all the developers.">
</HeadContent>
```

### SEO
By default, Spark apps use the `render-mode` of `server`. This means any code in your razor pages and components isn't ran until the SignalR connection is setup by the browser.

This has 1 downside, search engines will not be able to index your content. If SEO is important in your app, you will want to update the `render-mode` to `ServerPrerendered`.

You can do this by updating the render mode in `Pages/_Layout.cshtml` to:
```razor
<component type="typeof(HeadOutlet)" render-mode="ServerPrerendered" />
```

and updating the render mode in `Pages/_Host.cshtml` to: 
```razor
<component type="typeof(App)" render-mode="ServerPrerendered" />
```

>
> Using the render mode of `ServerPrerendered` has 1 side effect.
>
> Any code in your razor pages or components will be ran twice. Once on the server and once when the page is loaded in the browser.
>

### Navigation
Blazor pages use standard html anchor elements to navigate to other Blazor pages.
```razor
@page "/developers"

<a href="/">Go to home page</a>
```

### Authentication
To read about how to authenticate and access User data from your Razor components and pages, check out Spark's [Authentication guide](/docs/authentication).

## Layouts
Layout files define a top level template for pages in Spark apps.

Spark projects come with a MainLayout.razor file setup for you already in the `Pages/Shared` directory. All pages will use this layout by default.

### Creating Layouts
To create your own layout file, add a new razor component to the `Pages/Shared` directory. For example, `Pages/Shared/NewLayout.razor`.

Layout files need to have an `@Body` tag to let Blazor know where to render the pages content.
```razor
@* Pages/Shared/NewLayout.razor *@
@inherits LayoutComponentBase

<Header />

<main class="container">
    @Body
</main>

<Footer />

```

To use the new layout on a page, add the `@layout` attribute.
```razor
@page "/developers"
@layout NewLayout

<h2>Episodes</h2>
```

## Component Naming Conventions
Spark has conventions you should follow when creating your Razor components.

### File names
Most applications have standard CRUD pages for resources.

For instance, if you app stored developers in the database, your CRUD pages should be setup like the this:
- **Pages/Developers/Index.razor** (show all developers)
- **Pages/Developers/Show.razor** (show 1 developer)
- **Pages/Developers/Create.razor** (create a developer)
- **Pages/Developers/Delete.razor** (delete 1 developer)
- **Pages/Developers/Edit.razor** (edit 1 developer)

Razor components files should also use **PascalCase** naming.

### Route names
When setting your `@page` attribute in a Blazor page, the following conventions should be followed:

**1.** Use lower case kebab case. Ex. `@page "/users/show-me-a-user"`

**2.** Use plural names. Ex. `@page "/users"`

**3.** CRUD routes should follow this naming convention:

A Razor component with a path of `Pages/Users/Index` will have a route of:

 `@page "/users"`

A Razor component with a path of `Pages/Users/Show` will have a route of:

 `@page "/users/{id}"`

A Razor component with a path of `Pages/Users/Create` will have a route of:

 `@page "/users/create"`

A Razor component with a path of `Pages/Users/Delete` will have a route of:

 `@page "/users/delete/{id}"`

A Razor component with a path of `Pages/Users/Edit` will have a route of:

 `@page "/users/edit/{id}"`

>
> If you use the Spark CLI commands to create your Pages and Components, all of the route naming conventions will automatically be setup for you.
