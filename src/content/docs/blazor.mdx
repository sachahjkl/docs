## Introduction

Spark uses server-side rendereded Blazor (Blazor SSR) for it's routing and frontend views.

Blazor projects utilize Razor components to split your markdown into re-usable chunks. These components also have the ability to contain logic specific to themselves and even have url routes invoke them.

Razor components let you mix in HTML markup with C#, allowing you to quickly create dynamic components to use in your app.

```razor
@inject DeveloperService developerService
@code {
    private List<Developer> developers { get; set; }
    protected override void OnInitialized()
    {
        developers = await developerService.GetDevelopers();
    }
}

<ul>
    @foreach (var developer in developers)
    {
    <li>
        @developer.Name
    </li>
    }
</ul>
```

### Use of HTMX

Spark integrates the popular [Htmx](https://htmx.org/) library to enhance page navigations and form submissions.

## Components

Razor components are re-usable elements you can use anywhere in your application.

Your components should be created in the `Pages/Shared` directory.

### Creating Razor Components

To create a new Razor component, simply run the Spark make component command.

```bash
spark make component SomeComponent
```

A new Razor component named `SomeComponent.razor` will be created in the `Pages/Shared` directory.

```razor
<p>My Component</p>

@code {

    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
    {

    }
}
```

### Rendering Components

To display a component, you may use a Razor component tag within another Razor component or page. Razor component tags are just the name of it's source file.

```razor
<SomeComponent />
```

### Passing Data To Components

You can pass data to a Razor component or page by using **Component Parameters**.

Component parameters are defined using public C# properties on the component class with the `[Parameter]` attribute.

For example, below is a razor component called `ChildComponent.razor`. It accepts a parameter of `Title`.

```razor
<h1>@Title</h1>

@code {
    [Parameter]
    public string Title { get; set; } = "";
}
```

Then, in a parent Razor component, you can render the child component and pass the `Title` parameter value.

```razor
<div>
    <SomeComponent Title="This is my title" />
</div>

@code {
}
```

In this example, the following markup would ultimately be rendered to the browser.

```html
<div>
	<h1>This is my title</h1>
</div>
```

### Child Content

You will often need to pass additional content to your razor components via a `RenderFragment`. RenderFragments can be HTML markup or even other Razor Components.

For example, the below `ChildComponent.razor` component has a `ChildContent` parameter of type `RenderFragment`. This represents a segment of UI to render.

```razor
<h1>
    @ChildContent
</h1>

@code {
    [Parameter]
    public RenderFragment? ChildContent { get; set; }
}
```

Then, in a parent Razor component, you can render the child component while passing content between it's opening and closing tags.

```razor
<ChildComponent>
    Spark is <span class="text-yellow-600">Awesome!</span>
</ChildComponent>
```

In this example, the following markup would ultimately be rendered to the browser.

```html
<h1>Spark is <span class="text-yellow-600">Awesome!</span></h1>
```

### Dependency Injection

You can take advantage of ASP.NETâ€™s dependency injection system by adding the `@inject` directive in your Razor components.

.NET will automatically resolve the dependency for you provided it has been registered in the apps service container.

```razor
@inject IConfiguration Config

@code {
    private string name = '';

    protected override void OnInitialized()
    {
        name = Config.GetValue<string>("Developer:Name");
    }
}
```

### Lifecycle Methods

## Pages

Your Blazor pages should be created in the `Pages` directory.

A Blazor page is a Razor component with a `@page "/some-url"` attribute at the top that represents the url it's located at.

You can read more about Pages [here](/docs/pages)

## Layouts

Layout files define a top level template for pages in Spark apps.

Spark projects come with a MainLayout.razor file setup for you already in the `Pages/Shared` directory. All pages will use this layout by default.

### Creating Layouts

To create your own layout file, add a new razor component to the `Pages/Shared` directory. For example, `Pages/Shared/NewLayout.razor`.

Layout files need to have an `@Body` tag to let Blazor know where to render the pages content.

```razor
@* Pages/Shared/NewLayout.razor *@
@inherits LayoutComponentBase

<Header />

<main class="container">
    @Body
</main>

<Footer />

```

To use the new layout on a page, add the `@layout` attribute.

```razor
@page "/developers"
@layout NewLayout

<h2>Episodes</h2>
```
