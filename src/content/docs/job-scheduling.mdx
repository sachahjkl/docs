## Introduction
Configuring a cron job or windows task is common for web apps. Spark utilizes Coravel's [scheduler](https://docs.coravel.net/Scheduler/) to accomplish this.

## Setup
Spark registers the scheduler in the `Application.Startup.AppServiceRegistration.AddAppServices()` method for you.
```csharp
services.AddScheduler();
```

You can schedule jobs in the `Application.Startup.Scheduler.RegisterScheduledJobs()` method.
```csharp
public static class Scheduler
{
    public static IServiceProvider RegisterScheduledJobs(this IServiceProvider services)
    {
        services.UseScheduler(scheduler =>
        {
            // example scheduled job
            scheduler
               .Schedule<ExampleJob>()
               .EveryFiveMinutes();
        });
        return services;
    }
}
```

## Scheduling Jobs
Before scheduling a job, you need to do ensure it is registered in the service container as a scoped or transient service. You can read more about this [here](/docs/jobs).

Then you are ready to schedule your job.

As mentioned earlier, this is done in the `Application.Startup.Scheduler.RegisterScheduledJobs()` method.

### Scheduling Job With Paramaters
If you have a Job that expects parameters, you can use the `ScheduleWithParams<T>()` method.

```csharp 
public class ExampleJob : IInvocable
{
    private string _someParm;

    public WeatherJob(string param)
    {
        this._someParm = param;
    }

    public Task Invoke()
    {
        // lookup states weather data
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```

You can then configure this job in your scheduler like this.
```csharp
scheduler
    .ScheduleWithParams<ExampleJob>("some string param")
    .EveryHour();
```
