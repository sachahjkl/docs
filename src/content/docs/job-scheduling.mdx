## Introduction
Configuring a cron job or windows task is common for web apps. Spark utilizes Coravel's [scheduler](https://docs.coravel.net/Scheduler/) to accomplish this.

## Creating Jobs
To create a new job, simply run the Spark  `make job` command.

```bash
spark make job ExampleJob
```

A new job will be create in the `Application/Jobs` directory.

## Registering Scheduled Jobs
All scheduled jobs must be registered in the `Application/Startup/Scheduler.cs` class.
```csharp
public static IServiceProvider RegisterScheduledJobs(this IServiceProvider services)
{
    services.UseScheduler(scheduler =>
    {
        scheduler
            .Schedule<ExampleJob>()
            .EveryFiveMinutes();
    });
    return services;
}
```
