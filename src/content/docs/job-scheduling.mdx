## Introduction
Configuring a cron job or windows task is common for web apps. Spark utilizes Coravel's [scheduler](https://docs.coravel.net/Scheduler/) to accomplish this.

## Setup
Spark registers the scheduler in the `Application.Startup.AppServiceRegistration.AddAppServices()` method for you.
```csharp
services.AddScheduler();
```

Your individual jobs also need to be registered in the service container. This can be done in the `Application.Startup.AppServiceRegistration.AddJobServices()` method.
```csharp
private static IServiceCollection AddJobServices(this IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddTransient<ExampleJob>();
    return services;
}
```

## Defining Schedules
Jobs are scheduled in the `Application.Startup.Scheduler.RegisterScheduledJobs()` method.

Inside of that method, the `UseScheduler()` method is called. Your scheduled jobs and their intervals are defined inside of it.
```csharp
public static class Scheduler
{
    public static IServiceProvider RegisterScheduledJobs(this IServiceProvider services)
    {
        services.UseScheduler(scheduler =>
        {
            // example scheduled job
            scheduler
               .Schedule<ExampleJob>()
               .EveryFiveMinutes();
        });
        return services;
    }
}
```

### Scheduling Jobs With Parameters
If you have a job that expects parameters, you can use the `ScheduleWithParams<T>()` method.

For example, if you had a job that accepted a string parameter:
```csharp 
public class ExampleJob : IInvocable
{
    private string _someParm;

    public WeatherJob(string param)
    {
        this._someParm = param;
    }

    public Task Invoke()
    {
        // lookup states weather data
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```

You could pass the parameter like this:
```csharp
scheduler
    .ScheduleWithParams<ExampleJob>("some string param")
    .Hourly();
```

### Intervals
When scheduling jobs, you will also need to specify the interval in which they run. There are many schedule intervals that you may assign to a job:

```csharp
// Run the job using a Cron expression
.Cron("* * * * *")

// Run the job every second
.EverySecond()

// Run the job every five seconds            
.EveryFiveSeconds()

// Run the job every ten seconds
.EveryTenSeconds()

// Run the job every fifteen seconds
.EveryFifteenSeconds()

// Run the job every thirty seconds
.EveryThirtySeconds()

// 	Run the job every 3 seconds
.EverySeconds(3)

// Run the job once a minute
.EveryMinute()

// Run the job every five minutes
.EveryFiveMinutes()

// Run the job every ten minutes
.EveryTenMinutes()

// Run the job every fifteen minutes
.EveryFifteenMinutes()

// Run the job every thirty minutes
.EveryThirtyMinutes()

// Run the job every hour
.Hourly()

// Run the job at 12 minutes past every hour
.HourlyAt(12)

// 	Run the job once a day at midnight
.Daily()

// Run the job once a day at 1 p.m. UTC
.DailyAtHour(13)

// Run the job once a day at 1:30 p.m. UTC
.DailyAt(13, 30)

// Run the job once a week
.Weekly()

// Run the job on the first of every month midnight
.Monthly()
```

>
> The scheduler uses UTC time by default
>

### Day Contraints
Once you specify an interval, you can also restrict what day's the job is allowed to run on.
```csharp
.Monday()
.Tuesday()
.Wednesday()
.Thursday()
.Friday()
.Saturday()
.Sunday()
.Weekday()
.Weekend()
```

You can also chain these methods.

For instance, the following would mean a job runs every hour on Monday and Wednesdays:
```csharp
scheduler.Schedule<ExampleJob>()
    .Hourly()
    .Monday()
    .Wednesday();
```

### Timezones
By default, the scheduler uses UTC time to trigger jobs.

If you would like to run your schedules against a particular time zone, use the `Zoned()` method.
```csharp
scheduler.Schedule<ExampleJob>()
    .Hourly()
    .Zoned(TimeZoneInfo.Local);
```

### Preventing Job Overlap
By default, scheduled jobs will run even if the previous instance of the job is still running.

To prevent this, you may use the `PreventOverlapping()` method.

```csharp
scheduler
    .Schedule<ExampleJob>()
    .EveryMinute()
    .PreventOverlapping("SomeJob");
```

This method takes in one paramater, a unique string key. The key is whats used to determine if the job has an instance running or not when the scheduler goes to trigger a job.
