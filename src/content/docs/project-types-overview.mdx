## Introduction
Sparks primary project type is Blazor. We believe it is the future of Web UI's for ASP.NET and are supporting it as such.

However, Spark comes with several project templates. This gives you the flexibility to use whatever ASP.NET project type you'd like while also taking advantage of all the functionality Spark provides.

Every project template comes with the same Spark functionality and services. The main differences is how their routes, markup, and markup logic is constructed.

## Main Templates
### Blazor
The Blazor project template sets up a Blazor Server project for you.

Blazor projects utilize Razor components to split your markdown into re-usable chunks. These components also have the ability to contain logic specific to themselves.

For authentication and authorization, it uses cookie authentication.

To create a Spark Blazor project, simply run the following command.
```bash
spark new MyAppName -t blazor
```

### Api
The Api project template sets up a ASP.NET MVC API project for you.

For authentication and authorization, it uses JWT auth as a bearer token. It also comes setup with Swagger out of the box for easy testing.

To create a Spark Api project, simply run the following command.
```bash
spark new MyAppName -t api
```

## Other Templates
Spark also gives you the option of creating MVC or Razor Pages projects.

While we recommend using Blazor, we understand not all devs feel the same way.

These project templates give you all the backend features Spark provides but lacks some of the UI code generation tools you'd find in a Spark Blazor project.

### MVC
The MVC project template sets up a ASP.NET MVC project for you.

MVC projects follow the conventional Model-View-Controller pattern. For it's frontend, it uses the Razor templating engine and server side generation.

Every page in a MVC app is made up of a razor view file that corresponds to a controller method for it's logic.

To create a Spark MVC project, simply run the following command.
```bash
spark new MyAppName -t mvc
```

### Razor Pages
The Razor Pages project template sets up a ASP.NET Razor Pages project for you.

For it's frontend, it uses the Razor templating engine and server side generation. It differs from MVC in that it doesn't use controllers.

Instead, every razor view file can have a `PageModel` class to define that pages logic.

To create a Spark Razor Pages project, simply run the following command.
```bash
spark new MyAppName -t razor
```
