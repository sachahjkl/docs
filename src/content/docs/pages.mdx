## Introduction

Blazor allows you to assign a route directly to a component in your application. These are called Blazor pages.

To assign a route to a component, use the `@page` attribute at the top of your .razor file.

```razor
@page "/developers"

<div>
...
</div>
```

## Creating Blazor Pages

You can create a new Blazor page by hand or by running the following Spark CLI command:

```bash
spark make page Developers/Index
```

Just like a normal component, after running this command Spark will create a new file in your application at `Pages/Developers/Index.razor`.

```razor
@page "/developers/index"
@code {
    protected override void OnInitialized()
    {

    }
}

<h1>My Page</h1>
```

### Organizing Pages

It is advised to create your Blazor pages in a subdirectory of the `Pages` folder and not the root of the Pages folder.

For example, lets say our app has a list of developers and open source work they've done.

We would want the following pages in the `Pages/Developers` directory:

-   `Pages/Developers/Index.razor` Show a list of developers
-   `Pages/Developers/Show.razor` Show 1 developer
-   `Pages/Developers/Create.razor` Create developer
-   `Pages/Developers/Edit.razor` Edit developer
-   `Pages/Developers/Delete.razor` Delete developer

### Component Naming Conventions

Blazer pages and components should always use **PascalCase** naming.

```razor
<MyComponent />
```

## Routes

### Route Parameters

Parameters can be passed into a Blazor page through the url. For example, lets say you have a page to show the details about a developer.

You can setup a route parameter in your URL to pass in the Id. Then setup a public property in your Blazor page with the same name.

Route parameter names are **case insensitive**.

```razor
@page "/developers/{Id:int}"

@if (developer != null) {
    <h1>@developer.Name</h1>
}

@code {
    [Parameter]
    public int Id { get; set; }
	private Developer developer { get; set; }

	protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
	{
		developer = await _developerService.Get(Id);
	}
}
```

## Page title and metadata

You can set a Blazor pages `<title>` element by using the `PageTitle` component.

```razor
@page "/developers"

<PageTitle>This is the developers page</PageTitle>
```

To set metadata, like the pages description, use the `HeadContent` component.

```razor
@page "/developers"

<PageTitle>This is the developers page</PageTitle>
<HeadContent>
    <meta name="description" content="This is a page that shows all the developers.">
</HeadContent>
```

## SEO

Because Spark uses Server-side Rendered Blazor, all pages are rendered on the server and the HTML is then sent to the clients browser.

This means search engines can easily index your sites content.

## Navigation

Blazor pages use standard html anchor elements to navigate to other Blazor pages.

```razor
@page "/developers"

<a href="/">Go to home page</a>
```

HTMX will intercept the navigation and use an AJAX fetch request. The response will then be evaluated by HTMX and replace the content on the page without having to do a full page reload.
