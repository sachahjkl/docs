## Introduction
Blazor allows you to assign a route directly to a component in your application. These are called Blazor pages.

To assign a route to a component, use the `@page` attribute at the top of your .razor file.

```razor
@page "/developers"

<div>
...
</div>
```

## Creating Blazor Pages
You can create a new Blazor page by hand or by running the following Spark CLI command:

```bash
spark make page Developers/Index
```

Just like a normal component, after running this command Spark will create 2 new files in your application.

The first will be a code behind file: `Pages/Developers/Index.cs`
```csharp
namespace MyApp.Pages.Developers;

public partial class Index
{
    protected override void OnInitialized()
    {
        
    }
}
```

The second will be the Razor file: `Pages/Developers/Index.razor`
```razor
@page "/developers/index"
<div>

</div>
```

### Organizing Pages
It is advised to create your Blazor pages in a subdirectory of the `Pages` folder and not the root of the Pages folder.

For example, lets say our app has a list of developers and open source work they've done.

We would want the following pages in the `Pages/Developers` directory:
- `Pages/Developers/Index.razor`  Show a list of developers
- `Pages/Developers/Show.razor`  Show 1 developer
- `Pages/Developers/Create.razor`  Create developer
- `Pages/Developers/Edit.razor`  Edit developer
- `Pages/Developers/Delete.razor`  Delete developer

### Component Naming Conventions
Blazer pages and components should always use **PascalCase** naming.

```razor
<MyComponent />
```

## Routes


### Route Parameters
The Blazor router uses route parameters to populate corresponding component parameters with the same name. Route parameter names are case insensitive.

```razor
@page "/developers/{Id:int}"

@if (developer != null) {
    <h1>@developer.Name</h1>
}

@code {
    [Parameter]
    public int Id { get; set; }
	private Developer developer { get; set; }
    
	protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
	{
		developer = await _developerService.Get(Id);
	}
}
```

## Page title and metadata
You can set a Blazor pages `<title>` element by using the `PageTitle` component.
```razor
@page "/developers"

<PageTitle>This is the developers page</PageTitle>
```

To set metadata, like the pages description, use the `HeadContent` component.
```razor
@page "/developers"

<PageTitle>This is the developers page</PageTitle>
<HeadContent>
    <meta name="description" content="This is a page that shows all the developers.">
</HeadContent>
```

## SEO
By default, Spark apps use the `render-mode` of `server`. This means any code in your razor pages and components isn't ran until the SignalR connection is setup by the browser.

This has 1 downside, search engines will not be able to index your content. If SEO is important in your app, you will want to update the `render-mode` to `ServerPrerendered`.

You can do this by updating the render mode in `Pages/_Layout.cshtml` to:
```razor
<component type="typeof(HeadOutlet)" render-mode="ServerPrerendered" />
```

and updating the render mode in `Pages/_Host.cshtml` to: 
```razor
<component type="typeof(App)" render-mode="ServerPrerendered" />
```

>
> Using the render mode of `ServerPrerendered` has 1 side effect.
>
> Any code in your razor pages or components will be ran twice. Once on the server and once when the page is loaded in the browser.

## Navigation
Blazor pages use standard html anchor elements to navigate to other Blazor pages.
```razor
@page "/developers"

<a href="/">Go to home page</a>
```
