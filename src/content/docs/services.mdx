## Introduction
Services are regular C# classes where you can tuck away business logic or data access methods to make them re-usable throughout your application.

On top of this, Spark makes it easy to add your services to the DI Container.

## Creating Services
To create a Service, simply use the Spark `make service` command.

```bash
spark make service DeveloperService
```
A new class in the `Application/Services` folder will be created.

```csharp
public class DeveloperService
{
    public DeveloperService()
    {
    }
}
```

## Registering Services
Before you're able to inject and use your service, you need to register it in the DI container. Spark makes this easy. 

Simply add your service to the `AddCustomServices` method in the  `Application/Startup/AppServiceRegistration.cs` class.
```csharp
private static IServiceCollection AddCustomServices(this IServiceCollection services)
{
    ...
    services.AddScoped<DeveloperService>();
    return services;
}
```

That's it!

### Service Lifetimes
Services can be registered with one of the following lifetimes:

- Transient
- Scoped
- Singleton

#### Transient
Transient lifetime services create a new instance each time the service is requested.

```csharp
services.AddTransient<MyService>();
```

### Scoped
Scoped lifetime service get create a new instance 1 time per web request.

```csharp
services.AddScoped<MyService>();
```

### Singleton
Singleton lifetime services will last the entire lifetime of the application. For web apps, that means after the first request of the service, every subsequent request will use the same instance.

```csharp
services.AddSingleton<MyService>();
```

## Injecting Services
Once a service is registered, it can be injected into any Razor component or other registered classes.

#### Injecting a Service in a Razor component

Use the `[Inject]` attribute in a Razor component code behind file to inject your services.
```csharp

namespace MyApp.Pages.Developers.Index;

public partial class Index
{
    [Inject] public DeveloperService DeveloperService { get; set; }

	private List<Developer> _developers;

    protected override void OnInitialized()
    {
		_developers = await DeveloperService.GetAll();
    }
}
```

#### Injecting a service into another service

Use standard dependency injection.
```csharp
public class DeveloperService
{
    private readonly ProjectService _projectService;

    public DeveloperService(ProjectService projectService)
    {
        this._projectService = projectService;
    }

    public List<projects> GetDevelopersProjects(int developerId) 
    {
        return this._projectService.GetProjectsByDeveloperId(developerId);
    }
}
```
