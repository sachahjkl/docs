## Introduction
Spark uses Entity Frameworks models and migrations to query your data and maintain your applications database.

A model in Spark is a representation of the data in 1 database table.

The only caveat to this is the `BaseModel` class.

### BaseModel
All models in Spark should extend the `BaseModel` class. The `BaseModel` class has 3 properties.
- Id
- CreatedAt
- UpdatedAt

This means you don't need to create these properties on your models, they will always be created and usable provided you are extending the `BaseModel` class.

Your models should always extend the `BaseModel` class to avoid issues with the Spark Library internal code.

## Setup
### Creating a Model
To create a new model, simply run the Spark  `make model` command.

```bash
spark make model Developer
```

A new class in the `Application/Models` folder will be created.

```csharp
public class Developer : BaseModel
{
    public string Name { get; set; }

    public string Title { get; set; }
}
```

Then, add your model in the `DatabaseContext` class as a DbSet:
```csharp
public class DatabaseContext : DbContext
{
    public DatabaseContext(DbContextOptions<DatabaseContext> options) : base(options)
    { }

    public virtual DbSet<Developer> Developers { set; get; }
    ...
```

Now that your model has been added to your DbSet, your ready to run your migrations and add the model to your database as a table.

## Migrations

### Create Migrations
Once your models are registered in your `DatabaseContext`, you can create a migration. This essentially acts as source control for your database schema. 

To create a new migration, simply run the Spark  `make migration` command.

```bash
spark make migration AddDeveloperTable
```

A new file with your schema changes is created in the `Application/Database/Migrations` folder.

>
> ### Changing database types and migrations
> If you ever find your self in a scenario where you have created migrations and then decide to switch database types, you will need to clear your migration files out of the `Application/Database/Migrations` folder.
>
> Then, create and run your migrations again. This is because migration files for one database type might not work for another due to different feature sets in those databases.

### Run Migrations
You can run your migration to apply the changes to your database with the Spark `migrate` command.
```bash
spark migrate
```

Once migrated, your model now exists as a table in the database. You can query and update records of your model via the DbSet in the DatabaseContext class.

## Data Access & Queries
### Querying Models
Once you have created a model, added it to your Database Context, and migrated it, you are ready to start retrieving data from your database.

Each model registered as a DbSet in `DatabaseContext.cs` is a powerful query builder, allowing you to use LINQ queries to pull data from the underlying database table.

To start querying models, you simply need to inject your `DatabaseContext` and run a linq query on your registered models.

```csharp
public class DeveloperService
{
    private readonly DatabaseContext _db;

    public DeveloperService(DatabaseContext db)
    {
        _db = db;
    }

    public List<Developer> All() {
        return _db.Developers.ToList();
    }
}
```

As mentioned above, in Blazor Server, it is required to use the `DbContextFactory` to get a new instance of the `DatabaseContext`.

```razor
@page "/developers"
@inject IDbContextFactory<DatabaseContext> factory

<ul>
    @foreach (var developer in Developers) {
        <li>@developer.Name</li>
    }
</ul>

@code {
    private List<Developer> Developers = new List<Developer>();

    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
    {
        using var db = factory.CreateDbContext();
        
        Developers = await db.Developers.ToListAsync();
    }
}
```

### Saving Models
Spark comes with handy extension method called `Save` to help you save a record in 1 line.

```csharp
public class DeveloperService
{
    private readonly DatabaseContext _db;

    public DeveloperService(DatabaseContext db)
    {
        _db = db;
    }

    public void CreateDeveloper() {
        var developer = new Developer();
        developer.Name = "Kramer";
        _db.Developers.Save(developer);
    }
}
```

The `Save` method is the equivalent to this code if you were using Entity Framework normally.
```csharp
private void CreateDeveloper()
{
    // Using the Save() extension method
    _db.Developers.Save(developer);

    // Is Equivalent to this
    developer.CreatedAt = DateTime.UtcNow;
    _db.Developers.Add(developer);
    _db.SaveChanges();
}
```

### Updating Models
Updating models is similar to saving models. It can also take advantage of the `Save()` extension method, which will detect if it's an existing record for you.

```csharp
public class DeveloperService
{
    private readonly DatabaseContext _db;

    public DeveloperService(DatabaseContext db)
    {
        _db = db;
    }

    public void UpdateDeveloper() {
        var developer = await db.Developers.FindAsync(1)
        developer.Name = "Kramer";
        _db.Developers.Save(developer);
    }
}
```

The `Save` method is the equivalent to this code if you were updating an existing record with Entity Framework out of the box.
```csharp
private void UpdateDeveloper()
{
    // Using the Save() extension method
    _db.Developers.Save(ExistingDeveloper);

    // Is Equivalent to this in standard Entity Framework
    ExistingDeveloper.UpdatedAt = DateTime.UtcNow;
    _db.Developers.Update(ExistingDeveloper);
    _db.SaveChanges();
}
```

### Deleting Models
To delete a model, you can call the `Delete` extension method provided by Spark on a Database Context instance.


```csharp
public class DeveloperService
{
    private readonly DatabaseContext _db;

    public DeveloperService(DatabaseContext db)
    {
        _db = db;
    }

    public void DeleteDeveloper() {
        var developer = await db.Developers.FindAsync(1)
        _db.Developers.Delete(developer);
    }
}
```

The `Delete` method is the equivalent to this code if you were deleting an existing record with Entity Framework out of the box.
```csharp
private void DeleteDeveloper()
{
    // Using the Delete() extension method
    db.Developers.Delete(ExistingDeveloper);

    // Is Equivalent to this in standard Entity Framework
    db.Developers.Remove(ExistingDeveloper);
    db.SaveChanges();
}
```
