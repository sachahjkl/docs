## Requirements
Before creating your first spark project, you should ensure that your local machine has:

- **.NET 7** - You can find the download [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0).
- **Node and Npm** - You can find the download [here](https://nodejs.org)

Once you have the .NET 7 SDK installed, you will also need **Entity Framework Core tools**. This can be installed with a simple `dotnet` command in your terminal:
```bash
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
```

## Your First Spark Project
After you have installed the required dependencies, you will need to install the Spark CLI.
```bash
# Install the Spark CLI
dotnet tool install --global Spark.CLI
```

Then using the Spark CLI, install the Spark project templates.
```bash
# Install Spark's project templates
spark install
```

You are now ready to create your first Spark project!
```bash
# Create your first Spark project
spark new MyApp
```

>
> Spark comes with several project templates to choose from. You can choose to generate your project with a certain template by providing the `-t` option.
> 
> Blazor
> Example: `spark new MyApp -t blazor`
>
> Api
> Example: `spark new MyApp -t api`
>
> To read more about project templates, check out our documentation [here](/docs/project-templates)
>

Now that your project has been created, cd into the root folder and run `npm install`.

```bash
cd MyApp
npm install
```

You can now create and run your first database migration. This will create the User tables for authentication that comes with a fresh Spark project.
```bash
spark make migration User
spark migrate
```

Open your Spark project in the console by using Spark's `open` command. This will open it with your default IDE.
```bash
spark open
```

Finally, start .NET's local development server using the dotnet watch command:
```bash
dotnet watch
```

## Updating Spark CLI
The easiest way to update the Spark CLI is to uninstall and reinstall it.
```bash
dotnet tool uninstall -g Spark.CLI
dotnet tool install -g Spark.CLI
```

## Updating Spark's Project Templates
To update Spark's project templates, simply run the spark update command in your console.
```bash
spark update
```
