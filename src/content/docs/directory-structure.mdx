## Introduction

The Spark application structure is setup to give a consistant, organized project structure for your web application. 

Because Spark provides a defined structure for you, there are no suprises when starting work on new or existing Spark project.

However, you are still free to create classes wherever you'd like if you choose to.

## Application
The `Application` directory contains the core code of you application.

### Controllers
The `Controllers` directory contains your Controller classes. This directory is only generated for MVC project types.

### Database
The `Database` directory contains your `DbContext` and `Migrations` for EF Core.

### Events
The `Events` directory contains your event and listener classes. Events are used to alert other parts of your app that a given action has occurred. This provides great flexibility and decoupling.

### Mail
The `Mail` directory contains your mailable classes. Mailables are C# classes that represent a specific type of e-mail that you can send.

### Models
The `Models` directory contains your efcore model classes. Each database table for your application has a corresponding Model class that efcore will use to interact with that table.

### Services
The `Services` directory contains your services that can be Dependency Injected on startup. Services are typically used to abstract away business logic or database calls.

### Startup
The `Startup` directory contains Registration classes. These classes are where Sparks core services, custom services, events, or tasks are registered to the DI container. Scheduled jobs can also be registered here.

### Tasks
The `Tasks` directory contains queueable jobs for your application. Tasks can be scheduled or added to a background queue.

## Pages / Views
This is where your sites frontend markdown will be contained. If using the Blazor or Razor pages project types, the `Pages` directory contains your Razor pages and Razor components. If using the Mvc project type, The `Views` directory contains your Razor templates.

## Storage
The `Storage` directory contains your application logs if the Spark logger is setup to log to files. It also contains mail logs if your mailer is setup to log to files.

## wwwroot
The `wwwroot` directory contains your compiled CSS, images, and other frontend public dependancies you want to use.
