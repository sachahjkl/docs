## Introduction
Most web applications require some form of authentication. Spark provides this out of the box with it's own custom cookie auth implementation.

## User Model
Every Spark app comes with a `User.cs` class in the `Application/Models` directory. This acts as your schema for your users table and also the class that is used during authentication.

Users also have Roles tied to them for authorization. You can read more about that on the [Authorization page](/docs/authorization).
```csharp
public class User : BaseModel
{
    public User()
    {
        UserRoles = new HashSet<UserRole>();
    }

    public int Id { get; set; }

    public string Name { get; set; }

    public string Email { get; set; }

    public string Password { get; set; }

    public string? RememberToken { get; set; }

    public DateTime? EmailVerifiedAt { get; set; }

    public virtual ICollection<UserRole> UserRoles { get; set; }
}
```

## Scafolded Auth Pages
Spark builds the login, logout, register and profile edit pages for you. 

Feel free to customize their look and feel how you see fit. 

## Requiring Authentication for Routes & Pages
If you have routes in your app you only want logged in users to see, use the `Authorize` attribute.

**MVC Controller**
```csharp
[Authorize]
[Route("dashboard")]
public IActionResult Dashboard()
{
    return View();
}
```

**Razor Pages Model**
```csharp
[Authorize]
public class DashboardModel : PageModel
{
    public void OnGet()
    {
    }
}
```

**Blazor**
```razor
@page "/dashboard"
@attribute [Authorize]
<section class="max-w-5xl mx-auto py-28 min-h-screen px-4">
    <article>
        <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">
            User Dashboard
        </h1>
    </article>
</section>
```

## Accessing User Data
Spark comes with out of the box methods to make it easy to query the authenticated users data.

The `Application/Services/Auth/AuthService.cs` class comes with a `GetAuthenticatedUser()` method. This will return the User model if the person logged in or null otherwise.

The `AuthService` can be dependency injected in your controllers, services, or Razor components.
```csharp
private readonly AuthService _authService;

public DevelopersController(AuthService authService) {
    this._authService = authService;
}

[Authorize]
[Route("dashboard")]
public IActionResult Dashboard()
{
    var user = await _authService.GetAuthenticatedUser(User);

    ...
}
```

## Blazor Authorize View

Sometimes you want a user to see different content from a Razor component based on if they are authenticated or not.

You can accomplish this by using the `<AuthorizeView>` tag helper that comes with Blazor.
```razor
<nav>
    <AuthorizeView>
        <Authorized>
            <a href="/logout">Logout</a>
        </Authorized>
        <NotAuthorized>
            <a href="/login">Login</a>
        </NotAuthorized>
    </AuthorizeView>
</nav>
```
