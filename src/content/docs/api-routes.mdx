## Introduction

API routes in Spark are Minimal APIs that extend the `IRoute` interface.

On startup, Spark will register any of your classes implementing the `IRoute` interface as Minimal API routes. This makes it easy to setup API routes without much ceremony.

## Creating API Routes

To create an API route, create a class that extends the `IRoute` interface in the `Pages/Api` directory.

```csharp
// Pages/Api/Example.cs
using Spark.Library.Routing;

namespace SparkPoc.Pages.Api;

public class Example : IRoute
{
    public void Map(WebApplication app)
    {
        app.MapGet("/api/example", () =>
        {
            return Results.Ok(new { Hello = "World" });
        });
    }
}
```

Spark will automatically register this route for you on startup.

### Protecting Routes

You can protect routes you only want authenticated users to access using the `.RequireAuthorization()` method.

```csharp
...

app.MapGet("/api/example", () =>
{
    return Results.Ok(new { Hello = "World" });
}).RequireAuthorization();

...
```

You can furthur restrict access by passing roles to the `.RequireAuthorization()` method.

```csharp
.RequireAuthorization("admin");
```
