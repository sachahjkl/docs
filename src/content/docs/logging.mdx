## Introduction
To help you be aware of what's happening with your application, Spark provides a logging service to allow you to log messages.

Under the hood, Spark uses the [Serilog](https://serilog.net/) library.

## Configuration
Logging can be configured in your `.env` file.
```ini
LOG_CHANNEL=file
LOG_LEVEL=information
```

### Channels
Log channels control where your logs are written. There are currently 2 log channels..
- file
- console

### Levels
Log levels control the minimum level of event that is logged to your channel. 

For instance, if your log level is set to `warning`, only log messages with a warning level or higher will be logged. Debug and information logs would be ignored.
- debug
- information
- warning
- error
- fatal

It is recommended to set your logs to `warning` in production to avoid noise in your logs.

## Setup
The Spark logger is added to the DI container for you in `AppServiceRegistration.AddAppServices()`.

```csharp
services.AddLogger(config);
```

To use the logger, inject `Spark.Library.Logging.ILogger` via dependency injection.

```csharp
// class or controller example
private ILogger _logger;

public CacheController(ILogger logger)
{
    this._logger = logger;
}
```

```razor
@* razor component example *@
@page "/"
@inject ILogger _logger

```


## Writing Log Messages
Once injected, you may call any of these methods to log a message for the corresponding level.

```csharp
    _logger.Debug(message);
    _logger.Information(message);
    _logger.Warning(message);
    _logger.Error(message);
    _logger.Fatal(message);
```
