## Introduction
To help you be aware of what's happening with your application, Spark provides a logging service to allow you to log messages.

Under the hood, Spark uses the [Serilog](https://serilog.net/) library.

## Configuration
Logging can be configured in your `.env` file.
```ini
LOG_CHANNEL=file
LOG_LEVEL=information
```

### Channels
Log channels control where your logs are written. There are currently 2 log channels..
- file
- console

### Levels
Log levels control the minimum level of event that is logged to your channel. 

For instance, if your log level is set to `warning`, only log messages with a warning level or higher will be logged. Debug and information logs would be ignored.
- debug
- information
- warning
- error
- fatal

It is recommended to set your logs to `warning` in production to avoid noise in your logs.

## Writing Log Messages
The Spark logger is added to the DI container for you. You simply need to inject the `ILogger` interface into your controller, razor component or service. 

From there, you can write logging messages where needed.
```csharp
private readonly ILogger _logger;

public ClassConstructor(ILogger logger) {
    _logger = logger;
}

...

public LogMessage(string message) {
    _logger.Debug(message);
    // _logger.Information(message);
    // _logger.Warning(message);
    // _logger.Error(message);
    // _logger.Fatal(message);
}

```
